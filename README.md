# Covid19-Analysis-Java

There are 3 main analytics that were carried out:
1) Finding out the total number of active COVID-19 cases given daily data from various countries.
2) Finding out the number of cases in a given date range
3) Find the total number of cases per capita given population data (populations.csv)

Task 2 and 3 were carried out using both Spark and Hadoop.
